        Today, with so much information available and easily accessible, the
        pace of new startups being launched has reached unprecedented levels.
        Indeed, it has never been easier to start a company than in 2024,
        especially with the rapid progress in AI over the past few years. You
        can now launch a product in less than 24 hours. This leads to a
        saturated market of mass-produced, inexpensive SaaS products. Naturally,
        your first thought might be to create something more innovative to gain
        an edge over the competition.

      <p className="mt-5 text-white/80">
      However, this can lead to over-engineering
        and complicating your initial idea, as dozens of similar products
        already exist. This cycle often leaves you stuck with a product no one
        uses, and the process repeats. In a saturated market, a different
        approach is essential. First, consider why this market is saturated and
        what problem it aims to solve. By starting with this simple question,
        you gain insight into the core issues at play. If you still want to
        enter this specific market, don't just replicate existing solutions or
        rely on AI alone. Instead, seek out hidden problems within the sector.
        Public issues are often already addressed with existing solutions, so
        avoid rehashing those unless you can significantly improve them. The
        real opportunity lies in addressing hidden problems, as many remain
        unsolved and provide a chance to develop truly valuable solutions.

        Yes, there are still billion-dollar opportunities waiting to be
        discovered. As a founder, your role is all about investigation and
        finding these untapped solutions. Billion-dollar ideas are often simpler
        than you might think—simplicity is key. A straightforward concept led
        Facebook to become a trillion-dollar company, and the same is true for
        Airbnb, Uber, and many other top companies. You might think that as we
        advance, it's getting harder to innovate in a saturated market. But
        that's not true; there are still many unaddressed challenges waiting to
        be solved. However, it won't be easy—you have to be prepared to search
        for them relentlessly.
